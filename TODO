    RFE: typeahead search when only searching for packagenames
    
         <snip mail from James Antil>
			 Yeh, I was thinking of just package names ... and we'll probably need
			to add an API for that (or tweak searchNames()/returnPackages() to do
			just the prefix name search under certain conditions).
			 I'm pretty sure we are good speedwise though, doing a quick test here,
			with:
			
			       def _tst(pat):
			         tb = time.time()
			         ret = yb.pkgSack.returnPackages(patterns=[pat])
			         te = time.time()
			         print "time:", te - tb, "len:", len(ret)
			
			...I get:
			
			In [2]: _tst('yum*')
			Loaded plugins: presto
			time: 0.269106864929 len: 70
			
			In [3]: _tst('yum*')
			time: 0.0622339248657 len: 70

    RFE: History improvements
    	 - packages should be shown in a more packageview like way
    	 - possibillity to interact with packages in a history transaction
    RFE: Update info improvements
         - separate view like changelog / filelist
         - show previous updateinfo records
         - bugzilla records should be links
    RFE: Auto resolve deps when a package is added to queue
    	- Speed might be an issue here
    	
    RFE: Auto download packages when added to queue
    	- need some multi threaded downloader, there can be aborted if user select 'Apply' before
    	  downloading is completted.
    	  
   	RFE: Show multiple packages types and version
   	     - show if there is an availble update for a package it is shown, but the installed one is not
   	     - show old version packages too (like kernels)
   	     
   	RFE: Reinstall, Downgrade
   	     - make it possible to reinstall package(s)
   	     - make it possible to downgrade package(s)
   	     
   	RFE: Make it possible to type "install foo, remove bar" and get the packages added to the queue
   		 - get the same results as typing 'yum install foo" on the cmd line.
